# sports-activities backend API

This project is a backend API which allows us to programatically interact with the PSQL database, using node-postgres. 

To setup the test and devlopment databases, you will need to create a .env.test file and a .env.devlopment file. Each of these must include PGDATABASE=... and include the necessary database name, which can be found in the package.JSON file. 

You will also need to run:
 - npm install
 - npm install jest -D
 - npm install jest-sorted -D
 - npm install supertest
 - npm install pg
 - npm install dotenv

The hosted version can be found at https://sports-activities-be.onrender.com/api
